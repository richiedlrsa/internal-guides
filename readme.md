# Internal Guides and SOPs
    A web application to organize and manage internal policies and procedures.

## Description

This website allows organizations to easily store, organize and manage internal guides and SOPs, minimizing reliance on tribal knowledge. It includes secure user authentication and role-based access control. Users with the _user_ role can look up and view existing guides. Users with the _admin_ role can add, view, delete and update existing guides, as well as manage other users.

## Key Features
* **Secure User Authentication**: Ensures that the information is only accessible by authorized users.
* **Role-based Access Control**: Some functionalities will be disabled/enabled based on permissions (admin vs user).
* **Full Crud Functionality**:  Admins have complete control to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete existing guides.
* **Dynamic Search**: A powerful search bar allows users to instantly find guides by querying both titles and content.
* **Markdown Support**: Guide is rendered with Markdown, allowing for rich text formatting, including headers, lists, and links.
* **User Management**: Admins have access to a dedicated interface to view all users and manage their roles.
